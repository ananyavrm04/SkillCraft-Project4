In this project, static hand gestures are recognized using Python & OpenCV.
The model identifies gestures like 'Thumbs up','Peace sign',and 'fist'.
Tech stack - OpenCV, NumPY, Google Colab.
Key Techniques :- 
Contour and Convex Hull Detection: Extracting the hand shape from an image
Defect Analysis: Using convexity defects to analyze gaps between fingers for gesture recognition
Gesture Classification: Determining gestures based on the number of detected defects
